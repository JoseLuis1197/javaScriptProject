You could declare objects using these three ways:

1) var obj = {};
2) var nextObject = Object.create(Object.prototype);
3) var lasObject = new Object();

After declaring your object you could add keys and values as follow:

1) Dot notation

    obj.param = "new value";
    
    obj["param"] = "new value";
